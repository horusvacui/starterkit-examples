This is a collection of example patches for people who are just starting out with Pd.  The categories of example patches match the categories of objects that are in the category_menu for the starterkit mode.

This project was started at Eyebeam as part of an X-lab Residency and grew out of the NYC Patching Circle and work with New Blankets.
